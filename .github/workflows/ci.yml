# NOTES BEFORE STARTING
# Requirements are ordered based on difficulty, but there are no shame
# in searching on the official documentation or asking clarification
# questions. Take this exercise as a way to improve your knowledge experimenting directly with Github actions.
# Use the ci pipeline to give you feedback about your workflow, so
# push often and trigger the workflow as much as you need.
# Let's start!
#
# Your lovely 🦆 the EM has given you the task to implement the first draft of a CI
# pipeline for your Elixir project. The pipeline should format, test and create a release.
# You feel a bit scared, but don't worry, you can count on 🐼 the Devops Champion and their hints.
#
# 🦆 Requirements
#
# 1. Workflow should run **only** on pull_request opened targeting main branch
#
# 2. Create a job `format` that check code has been correctly formatted
#
#    - 🐼's HINT: remember that your code will be executed on the runner which is a bare
#      ubuntu machine, while your job requires elixir and erlang to execute mix commands.
#      Good news is that there is an official action (erlef/setup-beam) that you can use.
#
#    - 🐼's HINT: don't forget that your application needs all depedencies defined in mix.exs
#      (and mix.lock) to compile
#
#    - 🐼's HINT: elixir command for this kind of job is `mix format --check-formatted`
#
# 3. Create a parallel job `test` that run application's tests using same elixir and erlang version
#    used in job `format`
#
# 4. Create another parallel job `release` that create a mix release for your application using same
#    elixir and erlang version used in jobs `format` and `tests`

# "Good job!" exclaim 🦆 the EM. You're ready to close your laptop and go home when you hear them say
# "I think we can improve this first solution and make this CI more efficient!". While wondering if 🦆s
# are good with potatos or not, you ask them how you can improve your perfect solution.
#
# FIRST IMPROVEMENT
#
# "Right now we have 3 different jobs that download every time the same dependencies wasting time. We can
# fix this with the use of a cache system" says 🦆 the EM
#
# 1. Cache mix dependencies so that jobs can skip the `mix deps.get` step. Use `actions/cache` action and
#    run mix deps.get step conditionally if we miss the cache.
#
#    - 🐼's HINT: `actions/cache` requires you to define a key for your cache. Try to use something unique
#            for this. An often used function for this kind of things is the method `hashFiles` that creates
#            an hash starting from a file content. Which file would be the most adequate for
#            identify elixir dependecies?
#
#
# SECOND IMPROVEMENT
#
# "We are probably repeating a lot of code (installing dependencies, setup/checking cache) and it could
# be useful using a [`composite` actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)
# to DRY our workflow" ponder 🦆 the EM
#
# 2. Create a composite custom action in the repo that setup beam environment, setup cache, and conditionally
#    install mix dependencies
#
#   - 🐼's HINT: remember that since your custom action will live in the same repo of your workflow, you will still need
#           to checkout your repo before call the composite action
#

# Great job! At this point even 🦆 the EM is happy and you can go home. Why however there are some other requirements below?
# Next change is just to better understand usage of artifacts, but
# it's not something that you'll see often in Prima (at least not in this way). So proceed only if you want to
# challenge yourself
#
# GREET THE WORLD
#
# In the job `release` we create a new release, but we are actually not using it. In a real environment we'd
# probably upload its output (aka the `_build` folder) in an S3 bucket and then download it when deploying
# For this project we can do something simplier.
#
# 1. Upload the release artifact using `actions/upload-artifact` in the `release` job
# 2. Create a new job that should downloading the release artifact (with `actions/download-artifact`)
#    and then run the method `GhaWorkshop.greet()`.
#    Check that in the logs of the workflow (when green) you can read "Hello world!"
#
#   - 🐼's HINT: You can run commands from the release executable with command `./bin/RELEASE_NAME eval "your command"`
#   - 🐼's HINT: For your sanity and to not lose too much time, you must make the whole folder you downloaded as
#           artifact executable with `chmod -R +x`
#
